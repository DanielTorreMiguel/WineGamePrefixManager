# Wine Prefix Manager

## What is this?
This application is a small manager of wine configurations for Steam games. 
Steam games have their own exclusive wine prefix and in order to access it you need to know that games appID, which makes the process of modifying configurations tedious.
To solve this, the application scans user inputted steamapp directories to check which games have a wine prefix and then the user with the hit of a button can launch winetricks or winecfg to modify the settings.

## Is that it?
As of now yes!, there are plans to include wine prefix creation and other features so adding games to Lutris becomes easier too.
